# ADM_HW1
Two main files:
- `SubmissionsHW1.pdf` the pdf of all the pages of HackerRank's submissions.
- `Homework1.ipynb` the Python notebook that contains all of the submitted HackerRank's codes. For each submissions there is the code and, before that, a markdown section with the tittle of the exercise.
